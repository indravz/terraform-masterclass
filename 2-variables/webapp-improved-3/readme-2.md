# Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

This repository contains Terraform configurations for setting up infrastructure. Below are key sections to review:

## `subnets.tf` and Associated Variables in `variables.tf`

### Importance of `count`

The `count` parameter in `subnets.tf` specifies the number of backend subnets to create, based on the value of `var.backend_subnet_count`. The `index` variable represents the current iteration during the creation of subnets, ensuring unique names and configurations for each subnet.

The `slice` function is employed to dynamically select a CIDR block for each subnet based on its index.

## `security-group.tf` - Importance of `for_each`

The `for_each` expression in `security-group.tf` allows you to dynamically create security group rules based on the elements provided in the `var.allowed_additional_backend_ports` set.

## `backend.tf` - Importance of Conditional Expression

In `backend.tf`, the conditional expression is used to determine specific conditions during resource creation. It helps control the logic based on the value of certain variables, ensuring flexibility in the infrastructure setup.

## `locals` - How Locals Can Be Used with Expressions

Locals in Terraform provide a way to create reusable expressions within a module. You can use locals to simplify complex expressions or calculations, making your configurations more readable and maintainable.

## `outputs.tf` - How Output Differs for Regular Resources vs. Resources with `count` and `for_each`

In `outputs.tf`, observe how the output is structured differently for regular resources compared to resources that utilize `count` or `for_each`. The output reflects the variations introduced by these parameters during the resource creation process.

## Terraform Commands

### Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform in your project directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan Terraform Deployment

Review the output of the following command to understand the changes that will be applied:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply Terraform Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create or modify resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Ensure to review the output for `subnets.tf`, `security-group.tf`, and `backend.tf` to confirm that the instances are getting created as expected.
