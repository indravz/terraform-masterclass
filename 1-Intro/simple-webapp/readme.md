# Simple WebApp using Terraform

This repository contains Terraform scripts to set up a simple web application. Follow the steps below to deploy the infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

1. Create an IAM role for Terraform and set the following environment variables:

```bash
alias tf=terraform
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-2"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key_id>
```

2. Initialize Terraform workspace:

```bash
tf init
```

3. Plan the Terraform deployment:

```bash
tf plan
```

4. Add GCP Provider:

```bash
# Add GCP provider configuration here
```

5. Rerun Terraform plan (If errors occur, resolve inconsistencies):

```bash
tf plan
```

6. Upgrade Terraform (if needed):

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

7. Format Terraform code:

```bash
terraform fmt
```

8. Validate Terraform configuration for any syntax errors:

```bash
terraform validate
```

9. Plan the Terraform deployment:

```bash
terraform plan
```

10. Apply the Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Make sure to replace `<your_secret_access_key>` and `<your_access_key_id>` with your actual AWS credentials.
