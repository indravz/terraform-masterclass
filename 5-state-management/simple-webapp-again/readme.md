# Terraform Commands and State Management

This readme provides a step-by-step guide for using different Terraform commands and managing the state of your infrastructure.

## 1. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform in your project directory:
```bash
terraform init
```

## 2. Plan Terraform Deployment

Review the changes that Terraform will apply by running:
```bash
terraform plan
```

## 3. Apply Terraform Configuration

Apply the Terraform configuration to create or modify resources:
```bash
terraform apply
```

Demonstrate different resources, modes, and dependencies in the `.statefile`.

## 4. Show Terraform State

To display the current state, use the following command:
```bash
terraform show
```

## 5. List Terraform State Resources

List all resources in the Terraform state:
```bash
terraform state list
```

Show details of a specific resource, for example:
```bash
terraform state show aws_instance.web_1
```

Change directories and show state details for another resource:
```bash
cd ../../1-Intro/simple-webapp
terraform state show aws_instance.web_1
```

## 6. Move Terraform State Resources

Move a resource to a different state file:
```bash
terraform state mv -state-out=../../5-state-management/simple-webapp-again/terraform.tfstate aws_instance.web aws_instance.web
```

List the state files:
```bash
terraform state list
```

Change directories and list state files in the new location:
```bash
cd ../../5-state-management 
terraform state list
```

## 7. Import AWS Instance Manually

Create an AWS instance manually from the AWS console and import it into the state file:

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.web_2 i-0d4c6fc7df54f10b2
```

## 8. Remove Imported State Resource

To remove an imported resource from the state:

```bash
terraform state rm aws_instance.web_2
```

Comment out the import configuration in `import.tf` to prevent re-import.

## 9. Generate Config for Removed Resource

Generate configuration for the removed resource:
```bash
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generate-import.tf
```

Terraform will add the configuration for the removed resource in `generate-import.tf`.
